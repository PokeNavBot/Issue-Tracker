## Purpose

The purpose of this page is to act as an issue / feature tracker. No bot source is available here.

## How To

Click on the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/PokeNavBot/Issue-Tracker/issues) look / search for an existing issue. Voting thumbs up on an issue will increase its priority and attention. Duplicates will eventually be closed.

Be as detailed as you can and provide screenshots and any logs you may be able to gather from your device as they will greatly increase the time to a solution.
